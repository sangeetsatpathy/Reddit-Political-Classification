*****
""I'm a liberal, but that doesn't mean what a lot of you apparently think it does. Let's break it down, shall we? Because quite frankly, I'm getting a little tired of being told what I believe and what I stand for. Spoiler alert: not every liberal is the same, though the majority of liberals I know think along roughly these same lines:

1. I believe a country should take care of its weakest members. A country cannot call itself civilized when its children, disabled, sick, and elderly are neglected. PERIOD.

2. I believe healthcare is a right, not a privilege. Somehow that's interpreted as ""I believe Obamacare is the end-all, be-all."" This is not the case. I'm fully aware that the ACA has problems, that a national healthcare system would require everyone to chip in, and that it's impossible to create one that is devoid of flaws, but I have yet to hear an argument against it that makes ""let people die because they can't afford healthcare"" a better alternative. I believe healthcare should be far cheaper than it is, and that everyone should have access to it. And no, I'm not opposed to paying higher taxes in the name of making that happen.

3. I believe education should be affordable. It doesn't necessarily have to be free (though it works in other countries so I'm mystified as to why it can't work in the US), but at the end of the day, there is no excuse for students graduating college saddled with five- or six-figure debt.

4. I don't believe your money should be taken from you and given to people who don't want to work. I have literally never encountered anyone who believes this. Ever. I just have a massive moral problem with a society where a handful of people can possess the majority of the wealth while there are people literally starving to death, freezing to death, or dying because they can't afford to go to the doctor. Fair wages, lower housing costs, universal healthcare, affordable education, and the wealthy actually paying their share would go a long way toward alleviating this. Somehow believing that makes me a communist.

5. I don't throw around ""I'm willing to pay higher taxes"" lightly. If I'm suggesting something that involves paying more, well, it's because I'm fine with paying my share as long as it's actually going to something besides lining corporate pockets or bombing other countries while Americans die without healthcare.

6. I believe companies should be required to pay their employees a decent, livable wage. Somehow this is always interpreted as me wanting burger flippers to be able to afford a penthouse apartment and a Mercedes. What it actually means is that no one should have to work three full-time jobs just to keep their head above water. Restaurant servers should not have to rely on tips, multibillion-dollar companies should not have employees on food stamps, workers shouldn't have to work themselves into the ground just to barely make ends meet, and minimum wage should be enough for someone to work 40 hours and live.

7. I am not anti-Christian. I have no desire to stop Christians from being Christians, to close churches, to ban the Bible, to forbid prayer in school, etc. (BTW, prayer in school is NOT illegal; *compulsory* prayer in school is - and should be - illegal). All I ask is that Christians recognize *my* right to live according to *my* beliefs. When I get pissed off that a politician is trying to legislate Scripture into law, I'm not ""offended by Christianity"" -- I'm offended that you're trying to force me to live by your religion's rules. You know how you get really upset at the thought of Muslims imposing Sharia law on you? That's how I feel about Christians trying to impose biblical law on me. Be a Christian. Do your thing. Just don't force it on me or mine.

8. I don't believe LGBT people should have more rights than you. I just believe they should have the *same* rights as you.

9. I don't believe illegal immigrants should come to America and have the world at their feet, especially since THIS ISN'T WHAT THEY DO (spoiler: undocumented immigrants are ineligible for all those programs they're supposed to be abusing, and if they're ""stealing"" your job it's because your employer is hiring illegally). I believe there are far more humane ways to handle undocumented immigration than our current practices (i.e., detaining children, splitting up families, ending DACA, etc).

10. I don't believe the government should regulate everything, but since greed is such a driving force in our country, we NEED regulations to prevent cut corners, environmental destruction, tainted food/water, unsafe materials in consumable goods or medical equipment, etc. It's not that I want the government's hands in everything -- I just don't trust people trying to make money to ensure that their products/practices/etc. are actually SAFE. Is the government devoid of shadiness? Of course not. But with those regulations in place, consumers have recourse if they're harmed and companies are liable for medical bills, environmental cleanup, etc. Just kind of seems like common sense when the alternative to government regulation is letting companies bring their bottom line into the equation.

11. I believe our current administration is fascist. Not because I dislike them or because I can’t get over an election, but because I've spent too many years reading and learning about the Third Reich to miss the similarities. Not because any administration I dislike must be Nazis, but because things are actually mirroring authoritarian and fascist regimes of the past.

12. I believe the systemic racism and misogyny in our society is much worse than many people think, and desperately needs to be addressed. Which means those with privilege -- white, straight, male, economic, etc. -- need to start listening, even if you don't like what you're hearing, so we can start dismantling everything that's causing people to be marginalized.

13. I am not interested in coming after your blessed guns, nor is anyone serving in government. What I am interested in is the enforcement of present laws and enacting new, common sense gun regulations. Got another opinion? Put it on your page, not mine.

14. I believe in so-called political correctness. I prefer to think it’s social politeness. If I call you Chuck and you say you prefer to be called Charles I’ll call you Charles. It’s the polite thing to do. Not because everyone is a delicate snowflake, but because as Maya Angelou put it, when we know better, we do better. When someone tells you that a term or phrase is more accurate/less hurtful than the one you're using, you now know better. So why not do better? How does it hurt you to NOT hurt another person?

15. I believe in funding sustainable energy, including offering education to people currently working in coal or oil so they can change jobs. There are too many sustainable options available for us to continue with coal and oil. Sorry, billionaires. Maybe try investing in something else.

16. I believe that women should not be treated as a separate class of human. They should be paid the same as men who do the same work, should have the same rights as men and should be free from abuse. Why on earth shouldn’t they be?

I think that about covers it. Bottom line is that I'm a liberal because I think we should take care of each other. That doesn't mean you should work 80 hours a week so your lazy neighbor can get all your money. It just means I don't believe there is any scenario in which preventable suffering is an acceptable outcome as long as money is saved.""

Fascism is a virus that exploits a decent person’s good nature and desire for patience and understanding. It twists your desire for normalcy into a weapon and turns it back on you. If you do not speak out or act against it, you are complicit in it. It cannot be voted away (if that’s not already obvious). Patience and “understanding” are its fuel. The Nazi does not speak in your language; its only form of communication is fear and violence. You cannot “wait it out,” as no amount of blood can satiate it. It isn’t tied to a single person or party—though it often prefers the right—it will inhabit whatever host isn’t actively fighting it. It is, in effect, a living, breathing villain with unlimited time and resources at its disposal—like Satan.  
  
Four hundred thousand American grandfathers, great-grandfathers, and others gave their lives fighting fascism, with many millions more gravely injured or scarred by trauma. Many of us have seen the legacy of this damage firsthand. The absurdity of a man now making the hand gesture meant to praise Hitler and swear loyalty to him spits on that sacrifice. In fact, “spits on” is an understatement; it’s the biggest “fuck you” I can imagine being made to a veteran of that era.

At some point, the son asked me where I was from. I said California. He laughed and said that he calls it Commifornia. I let it pass. He then asked me on a scale from 1 to 10, whether I would vote for Trump. I said 0. 

The dad then looked at me and started shouting, ""you are a piece of shit."" He repeated it over and over. I tried to de-escalate the situation but he just kept saying it over and over. His son said that he was drunk, but that he was not wrong. I wished them a good evening as the son took his dad away. (still screaming).

1747935920.0,The Republicans are about to destroy the entire US healthcare system,"Rural hospitals get on average about 20% of their revenue from Medicaid, with some even higher. About 20% of discharges be it to skilled nursing faculty, long term facilities, or even home health are covered by Medicaid.  If you add in Medicare, the number jumps to greater than 50%.

Most of them are operating on a razors edge of staying open, with many closures even under current conditions.

A reduction of 5% of revenue is not feasible in a lot of communities.  A reduction of 20% would be catastrophic. The vast majority of rural hospitals would close.

Here is why it matters even to larger communities and hospitals.  Even the largest academic centers still get a portion of their funding from Medicaid. Losing that funding would likely not result in closure, but would result in cutbacks in staff and services.

With no local hospitals, people in all of those communities would have to go to the large hospitals for services. ER, inpatient and outpatient services would be overwhelmed quickly. 30+ ER wait times will become the norm. Boarding inpatients in the ER for days at a time will become the norm. The patients will be sicker, as a lot people who could have been easily treated will wait much longer for care and will be much sicker, requiring more and longer treatment.

Rural ambulance services will close. They depend on Medicaid for a large portion of their revenue as well. That and a 2 hour transfer to the closest hospital both ways for even the simplest hospital transfer wouldn’t be feasible either.

Nursing home and rehabs will close. They depend on Medicaid for a portion of their revenue. They also depend on local hospitals for simple things such an an X-ray after someone falls. It’s difficult to run a facility when if a resident falls, there is no ambulance service to transport a patient and no hospital in a 100 mile radius to transport them to. Without the skilled facilities to accommodate hospital discharges, inpatient stays will be prolonged in an already overstressed system.

In a lot of communities the healthcare system is one of if not the largest employer. All those jobs will vanish.

If this big beautiful bill passes and becomes law, the healthcare system will collapse. I know that the Medicaid cuts are phased, not immediate, but even small cuts could have devastating consequences that will have ripple effects across the entire system.

It will hit deep red rural areas the quickest and hardest, but the system isn’t build to absorb that damage. ",Liberal

Every day he walks free is one day closer to him coming back to finish the job of dismantling the pillars of our 234 year long constitutional republic.  The ideas expressed within our governing documents only remain in existence if we are willing and able to unabashedly defend them.  We need to stop walking on egg shells and bring forth charges against Donald Trump before his waves of fascism completely erode our country. A country which we inherited incumbent upon the condition that we pass it on to future generations.  A free Donald Trump is an abdication of our collective civic duty.  We need to be louder in our demands to see justice served lest we lose everything that so many before us dedicated their lives to building and defending.  No other cause can come to fruition if we cannot convene an uninterrupted sense of focus on demanding Trump be charged and convicted.  Let’s nip American fascism in the bud.,Liberal

1597246151.0,An open letter to those who may vote 3rd party......,"  

Greetings Democrats, Liberals, Bernie Bros., etc., 

I wanted to take a moment to type an open letter from the heart about the upcoming election. As we know by now, Kamala Harris was selected to be Joe Biden’s running mate. While this is been seen as mostly positive news, there is a large enough segment of upset people out there on Twitterverse encouraging people to vote third party candidate, that I feel compelled to appeal to complete strangers, if nothing else, to get them to consider the ramifications of their vote. 

Let me say up front, I was not a fan of the prospect of Joe Biden being the nominee. He was not my first choice, nor was he my 2nd, 3rd, honestly, he was toward the bottom of the list. I was full on team Bernie. Joe Biden is about as exciting as dry oatmeal. And yes, I do believe Bernie Sanders was strong armed out of the election in both 2016 and 2018. In 2017, I left the Democratic party to NPA. I feel strongly I made the right decision.  After the announcement of Harris being the VP selection, I saw many people start saying they were going to vote for the Green Party candidate because he better represented their progressive views. I understand that, and I respect that mindset. In America, no one should “shame” another into voting for a preferred candidate…

However….

Before you vote for someone that isn’t Joe Biden, I just want you to keep one thing in mind: Whoever wins this election will fill the Supreme Court vacancy from Ruth Bader Ginsburg. She is tough as nails, but she is dying, and it’s very likely she’s not going to live for another 4 years. If Donald Trump wins re-election, he will fill that seat with a young, conservative jurist. It’s also likely Trump will fill at least one or two more seats on the Court as well. If that happens, it will cement a conservative majority. Any hope you have about Medicare for all, environmental protections, voting rights for felons, all that will be lost. In addition, you better believe that gay marriage, Roe V. Wade, legalized weed and civil rights protections will be gutted. Trump and McConnell aren’t even hiding the fact this is their endgame. This is exactly why they have put up with Trump’s crap the last 4 years. If we wait until 2024 and nominate someone like AOC, or another very progressive candidate, and they win, it won’t matter, because any proposed legislation will be struck down by the Supreme Court. 

America got it wrong in 2016, and it cost this country two seats on the Supreme Court to pave the way for a better future for us. I am very concerned we may be heading down this road again. For you liberals and progressives out there who aren’t thrilled about a Biden Presidency, I guess what I’m saying is perhaps we need to suffer with some dry oatmeal for a while to get to something better. If you have read this far, I thank you for reading, and I just ask that you really do some soul searching before voting third party.",Liberal

I myself am a fan of Bernie Sanders and will definitely be voting for him in the primary, and of course I will vote for just about anyone in the general election.

That being said, we need to focus on something that has been stated time and time again the last three years: Trump is a symptom of the problem, not the root. The root is two-sided: The U.S. government is not as invulnerable to corruption as many people like to believe (which means the Constitution itself needs revision), and Republican lawmakers (note, I'm not targeting their voters) have been more than happy to take advantage of this corruptible nature.

For this reason, the Left should be investing way more resources in Congressional races. If the Left takes control of Congress, we can A) block Judicial appointments in the case of a Trump victory, B) began pushing through legislative ground work for Constitutional change (even if it's vetoed at the top), and C) impeach AND CONVICT those who must be held accountable.

Also I'm crossposting this but can't figure out how to do it officially, sorry if that's annoying to anyone.

EDIT I: I really appreciate everyone's contribution to this discussion! To those who disagree with the strength of the stance I take in the title - honestly, you're right. To those who are pointing out the importance of all elections - you're also right! More than anything, I wanted to highlight that we ought to be diversifying our attention, and I don't see much discussion on this topic (I'm usually the first to bring it up in my circles, even though they tend to consider themselves politically savvy). All in all, get out the vote, and donate to Democrats opposing Republicans if you can! If you can't, talk about it!! Open up the conversation with those you know, spread the word, convince those who are on the fence!

in 2021, when it became apparent that trump had lost the election, he insighted an insurrection in an attempt to have his followers overthrow the government and give him another term. attempting to overthrow the government IS treason. all of the rioters who survived that terrible day are being tried for treason and, if there is any justice in the world, they will be convicted.  
  
now, after everything he has done to this country, trump has the fucking audacity to run for president again as if we would want him back. this man who attempted to overthrow the government when it became quite apparent that he had lost.  
  
if you vote for him, you will be committing treason. you will be helping someone who attempted to overthrow the government be put back into a position where he could do it again. if he gets reelected, every single person who voted for him will be guilty of treason and, if there was any justice in the world, they would be tried and convicted for it. i don't care how authoritarian i sound. that is the truth of the matter.

1732826410.0,A horrifying reality of Trump's 2nd term. NO ONE is safe from p2025. Am I the only one seeing this?,"Can we start to assume that no one this time in the white house will ever be liable for anything anymore so long as their lips are aligned with Trump's asshole and suck whatever comes out?

No one on his Legion of Doom will ever have consequences for their actions until they devour themselves for power over whatever is left standing when they are done using anyone that goes against them for slave labor.

I've been calling this game MAGAtes and p2025 have laid out for years.. but I need to run it by other liberals that can be objective and tell me I'm not right. I hope I'm not.

If you can follow this logic and have any decent memory of events in the past 3 Republican terms, you might feel like this is an actually real scenario... If I'm way off on something please call me out. I'm not saying this will be exact, but that the end result will be the same regardless of the how's and when's.

We won't have mass deportation like he's saying but there will be laws that ramp up justice arm's power to get rid of and imprison people here slowly over time .. which eventually through p2025 can fall on ANYONE they decide they wish to detain or get rid of.. even US born citizens. They will have the power to decide unilaterally and disregard civil rights and due process.

It will start with the undocumented immigrants they locate.. then find people who are expendable or have criminal records, people with addictions or that have had govt assistance, down to people that just aren't ""American"" enough, dangers or non-patriots.. they will be rounded up to be ""reformed."" They'll use camps for these people and work their way down the list until you have his side, and those suffering doing Chinese/gulag/gestapo-style govt labor to achieve forever power and control over us. You can change the terms and methods but let's assume they can do what they want, because they have everything they need now to do so.

Think it's crazy? Conspiracy? Yeah I get it but sometimes we see things before they happen and never listen to the ones who warned us. But it's all in the 2025 playbook and we've been here before. This time only the people can stop it, but that won't happen when we're scared and shut in our homes asking for help, saying yeah but not MY family right?

All they need to do is what I've been saying for years, declare another seemingly needed, but ultimately bullshit ""war.."" 

I think this time it will be the ""war on immigration"" or something so they can make up emergency war time acts/laws.. just like the war on terror. Which was how we got the patriot act..  remember that? Civil liberties trampled on, privacy violated. We were scared, so they were allowed to quell our fears, but what they were really doing was not targeted at terror and our enemies, but at Americans themselves. 

People are scared again, and just like COVID you get rich by causing a problem and selling the solution. This time I truly feel like they're going to take everything from us.. and what I fear more is that they know we can't sustain our population anymore, and they intend to close ranks, save themselves, and watch the rest of us slowly fade into genocidal memory. 

But I'm crazy of course to say this so fuck me right?",Liberal

It seems highly unlikely that both the turnout overall was lower AND Trump converted people from D to R. So the loss was due to a lack of enthusiasm on the Democratic side. I know people will say it's the Comey effect for Hillary and try to lump the economy/immigration/LGBTQ rights for Harris. But that seems to be less likely given the enthusiasm bump she should have gotten from Trump's campaign antics, Roe v Wade, replacing Biden, a great VP pick, etc.

Can we just admit that a good portion of this is to be due to their gender?

And I know some people will state reasons why they didn't like her. Hillary was ""unlikeable"" and people are saying that Kamala ""didn't connect with me"", but both of those are subjective and likely due to unconscious sexism. People didn't have to say ""I'll never vote for a woman"" for it to be sexism. They could just find reasons that they didn't like Hillary/Harris that they wouldn't have found if they were men.

June 17, 2025 - A leading expert in election forensics, Dr. Walter Mebane, Jr. of the University of Michigan, has found statistical evidence of vote manipulation in the 2024 U.S. election. His working report analyzing the 2024 Pennsylvania election results corroborates the findings of Election Truth Alliance’s (ETA), a non-partisan nonprofit that recently shared an analysis of election results in three counties in Pennsylvania. 

Dr. Mebane states in his Pennsylvania analysis that it is possible that “the election was decided or nearly decided by malevolent distortions of electors’ intentions”. 

Mebane is recognized internationally as a leading authority on election fraud detection, and his analysis of Pennsylvania employed his independent “eforensics” model. This model has been validated in professional scientific publications and has been used to evaluate the integrity of elections in countries such as Venezuela, Turkey, and Kenya. 

Mebane’s analysis examines 7,040,360 votes across 67 Pennsylvania counties. The eforensics model estimates that between 25,000 and 225,440 votes in the Presidential race were possibly fraudulent. The range is due to Dr. Mebane applying several different forensic models in completing his evaluation. 

The ETA recently conducted an independent analysis of election results from three Pennsylvania counties: Philadelphia County, Allegheny County (which contains Pittsburgh), and Erie County. Their analysis identified patterns consistent with vote manipulation in all three counties, particularly in election day voting result data.

 Working with Pennsylvania residents, the ETA has submitted ballot inspection requests in several counties across the state. The organization has also requested a meeting with the Pennsylvania Secretary of the Commonwealth, Al Schmidt, in their continued pursuit of a hand audits of paper voting records from the 2024 U.S. General election.

“Statistics, no matter how accurate, cannot provide definitive proof of voting fraud or election manipulation,” said Nathan Taylor, Executive Director of the ETA. “Actual proof can only be found by comparing paper ballot audits to electronic voting records. However, statistical information from eforensics and other data analysis approaches can, and should, be used to identify precincts and counties where election fraud is most likely to have occurred.” 

The Election Truth Alliance is a non-profit, non-partisan organization that supports election analysis, informed discussion, and peaceful action to identify and highlight potential election manipulation, interference, and irregularities. Dr. Mebane’s full report on the 2024 Pennsylvania election results is available at:

1739965480.0,Make Republicans Remove Trump from Office,"It sounds unrealistic.  And right now it probably is.

However, it can happen if Republican members of Congress are forced into a situation where their only choices are to remove Trump from office or be removed from office themselves. 

The impetus for this is already in the works.  The internet is abuzz with people regretting their vote for Trump due to losing their jobs, having their farming businesses hurt, the possibility of losing their Medicaid or paying higher prices due to his tariffs, and Elon Musk raiding sensitive information from government data bases. 

The basis for impeaching Trump is also plentiful.  He had already committed high crimes and misdemeanors even before taking office, and since has been pumping out one unconstitutional executive order after another.  There’s obviously a lot of illegal stuff going on right now, so it’s time Republicans in Congress were forced to do the right thing. 

That means turning public opinion against them for their complicity with Trump’s actions, denouncing them publicly and across social media.  It means bombarding them with angry calls and letters, threatening to vote them out in the next election if they don’t remove Trump now.  It means hundreds of people showing up at their offices with protest signs and megaphones, making clear if they don’t ditch Trump their political careers are over. 

The efforts to force Republicans to remove Trump must also include overwhelming pressure to have Musk expelled from the government.  Once Trump and Musk are gone, a clear message must be sent to Vance that if he continues the criminality of his boss, he will be the next to go.",Liberal

1557976265.0,Why do liberals think Trump supporters are stupid,"This is going around so I thought I would share it here                                                                      Authors name at the bottom       

An anguished question from a Trump supporter: ""Why do liberals think Trump supporters are stupid?""

The serious answer: Here’s what we really think about Trump supporters - the rich, the poor, the malignant and the innocently well-meaning, the ones who think and the ones who don't...

That when you saw a man who had owned a fraudulent University, intent on scamming poor people, you thought ""Fine.""

That when you saw a man who had made it his business practice to stiff his creditors, you said, ""Okay.""

That when you heard him proudly brag about his own history of sexual abuse, you said, ""No problem.""

That when he made up stories about seeing muslim-Americans in the thousands cheering the destruction of the World Trade Center, you said, ""Not an issue.""

That when you saw him brag that he could shoot a man on Fifth Avenue and you wouldn't care, you chirped, ""He sure knows me.""

That when you heard him illustrate his own character by telling that cute story about the elderly guest bleeding on the floor at his country club, the story about how he turned his back and how it was all an imposition on him, you said, ""That's cool!""

That when you saw him mock the disabled, you thought it was the funniest thing you ever saw.

That when you heard him brag that he doesn't read books, you said, ""Well, who has time?""

That when the Central Park Five were compensated as innocent men convicted of a crime they didn't commit, and he angrily said that they should still be in prison, you said, ""That makes sense.""

That when you heard him tell his supporters to beat up protesters and that he would hire attorneys, you thought, ""Yes!""

That when you heard him tell one rally to confiscate a man's coat before throwing him out into the freezing cold, you said, ""What a great guy!""

That you have watched the parade of neo-Nazis and white supremacists with whom he curries favor, while refusing to condemn outright Nazis, and you have said, ""Thumbs up!""

That you hear him unable to talk to foreign dignitaries without insulting their countries and demanding that they praise his electoral win, you said, ""That's the way I want my President to be.""

That you have watched him remove expertise from all layers of government in favor of people who make money off of eliminating protections in the industries they're supposed to be regulating and you have said, ""What a genius!""

That you have heard him continue to profit from his businesses, in part by leveraging his position as President, to the point of overcharging the Secret Service for space in the properties he owns, and you have said, ""That's smart!""

That you have heard him say that it was difficult to help Puerto Rico because it was the middle of water and you have said, ""That makes sense.""

That you have seen him start fights with every country from Canada to New Zealand while praising Russia and quote, ""falling in love"" with the dictator of North Korea, and you have said, ""That's statesmanship!""

That Trump separated children from their families and put them in cages, managed to lose track of 1500 kids. has opened a tent city incarceration camp in the desert in Texas - he explains that they’re just “animals” - and you say, “well, ok then.”

That you have witnessed all the thousand and one other manifestations of corruption and low moral character and outright animalistic rudeness and contempt for you, the working American voter, and you still show up grinning and wearing your MAGA hats and threatening to beat up anybody who says otherwise.

What you don't get, Trump supporters in 2019, is that succumbing to frustration and thinking of you as stupid may be wrong and unhelpful, but it's also...hear me...charitable.

Because if you're NOT stupid, we must turn to other explanations, and most of them are less flattering.

They support attacking our allies and opening up avenues for China to replace us in the global trade system. For a group whose motto is “Make America Great Again”, why do they consistently support policies aimed at crippling United States? 

Trump’s tariffs are the biggest tax on American consumers since the 1940’s. It will cost the average American at least $1,000 dollars per year in consumption taxes, without accounting for retaliatory effects. We are both reducing our food supply workforce via deportation (even of legal citizens) and taxing the food supply via tariffs. A double whammy on price increases and inflation. Not to mention, he randomly poured out a large portion of California’s water supply for quite literally no reason, depleting the water available for our farmers this summer for irrigation. 

Canada is our countries biggest supplier of energy. We are taxing that, too. We are taxing CANADA more than CHINA, who is the best positioned country to supplant us in global trade with both Canada and the EU. We are releasing cop beaters back into society and providing an unelected, non-government official in Elon Musk (who has significant business with and in China) with our private citizen’s information on banking and addresses.

Trump has spent two weeks focused explicitly on crippling the American economy, reducing our access to goods and services, making the ones we do have access to more expensive, and ensuring that things only get much worse from here. Conservatives meanwhile are whining and crying about Democrats, DEI, and people wanting to keep their bills down. They are cheering on inflation, government control of your personal information, China, and weakening of national security. It’s truly baffling how much they are rooting against their own country.

“Guys, it's better to cancel your subscription by calling or chatting with their support. 

This increases their customer service time and drives up their call volume. Companies monitor when call centers have high queues, so it gets noticed. Customer support also logs every cancellation and files them under categories, which means Disney will clearly see how many subscribers they're losing for that reason. 

If you were just charged, you can also request a refund. And hey, don't take it out on the representative. Give them a good survey so they can still get their bonus. In the end, Disney loses money three ways: by losing customers, refunding your charge, and paying bonuses to their reps ;) 

Ps if you already cancelled online, you can still call them for immediate cancellation.”

1605465531.0,My dad is an extreme Trump supporter,"This is going to be quite a long post. I need to vent and want some outside perspectives.

I am liberal and my dad is an extreme Trump supporter. Over the past 4 years, it has been hard. As a result in the recent months, we setup a civil debate on topics that we alternate who decides. I'm looking for anyone with any experience in this and can offer some advice.

Here is my story...

# Background

I grew up approx. 40 minutes outside New York City. Both of my father's parents are liberals. My dad is educated, Jewish, has an immigrant wife, had an abortion for his girlfriend at 22, exposed to diversity on a regular basis since he works in NYC and at one point was considered liberal.

He became a republican, when Bush ran, for financial reasons. However, he is now a pro-life, anti-liberal, gun obsessed, Fox News loving, all in Trump fanatic. He reasons and believes every one of Trump's lies(and those who support him).

When Trump was elected in 2016, I tried to avoid all talks about politics to avoid the blow up fights. To be honest, it ate away at me every day. I thought to myself how could this privileged and educated man be so brainwashed. This summer when COVID hit and BLM protests broke out I started to boil. I thought about how to approach the situation with my dad and my execution went pretty poorly. It ended up being a phone call where he was screaming ""planned parenthood is a baby killing mill"" and more outrageous comments.

At that point I froze, this man who told me when I was younger I could be whatever I wanted, to look at all people equally and inclusiveness is better than exclusiveness was not the man who I was talking to. I told him straight-up I don't see us having more than surface level relationship and I can't have this toxicity in my life. I told him I thought he was on the wrong side of history, which actually brought silence, I felt that got to him for some reason(but thats an assumption). I also continued to tell him that his uneducated and unverified claims did not warrant such an emotional response. Surprisingly, at that point my dad suggested we do monthly debates.

# The Debate

Each month we alternate who picks a topic. After he suggested this I put together a debate doc to help structure each debate. I even had us put our goals down for what we want to achieve in this process, so we can remind ourselves whenever things got heated. The structure is we have 2-3 days to pick a topic after our prior debate, 2 weeks for us to both provide research(articles, documentaries, videos, etc.) to support our claim and then an additional 2 weeks to review each others research.

The first topic I decided on was **False information is a serious problem with irreversible consequences that cause a massive divide in America.** I did this to plan how we would conduct our research, deem what sources are credible, decide on tools we would use to fact check and define certain terms. This was setup to prevent a back and forth on what is fact and fiction.

I wanted to encourage him to think twice before believing information he read from biased sources and  verify his information using other sources. A goal of mine is to have productive debates based on educated, well sourced and non-partisan content. While agreeing that some of our content would be biased and left/right leaning, but the claims made need to be based on **credible facts**.

My research included:

* [How Your Brain Tricks You Into Believing Fake News](https://time.com/5362183/the-real-fake-news-crisis/)
* HBO's [After Truth](https://www.hbo.com/documentaries/after-truth-disinformation-and-the-cost-of-fake-news)
* A [John Oliver clip](https://www.hbo.com/video/last-week-tonight-with-john-oliver/seasons/season-7/episodes/138-episode-197/videos/july-19-2020-coronavirus-conspiracy-theories)
* [YouTube Radicalization](https://medium.com/@markoledwich/youtube-radicalization-an-authoritative-saucy-story-28f73953ed17) \- this was to help show my understanding that even liberals can produce fake news. My goal was to help see that I try to find the truth with FACTS over opinion.

His research included:

* [This is how fake news spreads](https://www.dailysignal.com/2020/01/14/this-is-how-fake-news-spreads/)
* A article that no longer exists, but essentially it  discussed Google extending fact checking to image search
* Unfreedom Press by Mark Levin, that we both agreed was far too long to get through in 2 weeks - *Reddit even reported this as fake, so I removed the link*

My approach to this, was to review the limited research he provided. I read Dennis Pragner's article and it seemed apparent this guy focused on his opinion over facts. First, I used a few fact checkers on Dennis to see his credibility, which was amazingly low. To prove this, I went through roughly 10-15 of Dennis's most recent articles and put together data.

* One spreadsheet listed his 13 most recent articles how many times he used the words left leaning words such a **Left, Democrat,** and **Liberal** and right leaning words such as **Right, Conservative** and **Republican.**
* Then I researched top spin words & phrases, subjective statements and emotional terms to see how he was using emotion to persuade his audience of his claims. I created a doc highlighting how often he used these terms.
* Also in the doc with the content from his articles I made a list of all words that he surrounded the left leaning terms he used in the first spreadsheet.

My results were that he used used *112 left leaning words* and *8 right leaning words*. Some examples of the words he used surrounding the left included:

* Every *leftist*
* Lying
* Russian collusion
* Indistinguishable
* Brands
* Abolish standards
* As they have done for decades
* Denounce
* Reaction
* Mantra
* Bringing America down
* The communists
* Don’t give a damn
* *If* *the left* cared

Anyway, without my opinion and solely using Dennis's words I was able to convince my dad that Dennis was not credible. It was a victory I did not think I'd get so easily. I felt after our first debate that we made real progress. He even went as far to say ""Yeah, I don't know why I was getting so emotional and I won't read Dennis Pragner anymore"" It was awesome.

The victory I felt was not based on that he agreed with me, but that we were able to agree on verifiable facts. This is and has been my goal so far. Let's get past debating what is verifiably true, since to me it's common sense and obvious, and let's focus on factual information that we can discuss.

As a result from our first debate we agreed upon certain definitions, a few tools we can use to fact check and how we would judge credibility and that we want to avoid content with extreme bias.  In addition, we shared an understanding that there will be manipulation and bias in documentaries, articles, etc., we send each other to persuade the audience of what the author is saying. However, the claims, evidence and research the author presents must be factual. **There is a difference of using manipulation and bias to convince the audience of false information and verified information.** This is what we as an audience have to judge, is the bias or manipulation credible?

# The Problem

However, it feels like all the work I am doing and how far we get, the progress just reverts. I'm frustrated and don't know when I should just throw in the towel. The second debate we had, my dad decided on **Appointment of Supreme Court Justices**. The debate was ok, but I didn't spend as much time as I did in the first debate. I learned a lot, however I felt there wasn't much for us to debate. However, I still felt we were on the right track and agreed upon being factual versus emotional/opinionated on unverifiable facts. His research supported this and was way more interesting and factual this time around.

For our upcoming debate I decided on **The Republican Party’s Conflict with Science & How it Affected America’s Response to COVID-19**. Both of our research was due last Thursday and here is the list:

* [A Sensible and Compassionate Anti-COVID Strategy](https://imprimis.hillsdale.edu/sensible-compassionate-anti-covid-strategy/?utm_term=emailclicks&utm_campaign=imprimis&utm_medium=housefile-email&_hsmi=98690753&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9k8qDZgV-TFamTIpUNpPp3hyR86Vzn95oIJtK1Q7eeuZ1IPVHEGpsBuO7HCun2VtMf48ypDCX-zVReAGGamAEiUohXvg&utm_content=SensibleAntiCOVIDStrategyOCT&utm_source=email)

Initially I read the Breitbart article, [CDC Journal: Cloth Mask 'May give users a False Sense of Protection' against Coronavirus'](https://www.breitbart.com/health/2020/10/28/cdc-journal-cloth-masks-may-give-users-a-false-sense-of-protection-against-coronavirus/), which refers to COVID-19 as the Chinese virus(first red flag). From the fake news discussion, I felt we were aligned. I don't want to have to go through the exercise I already did or use the limited time we have for our debate on what is credible information. I had hoped we were moving past this. I decided to message him ""it's hard for me to take an article seriously, when they are consistently referring to COVID-19 as the Chinese virus."" We had a small back and forth, but it was civil and he understood. In addition, I searched a few fact checkers on Breitbart's credibility and it's labeled as a questionable source, extreme right-wing bias and publication of conspiracy theories and propaganda with numerous false claims. It shows he did zero fact checking here, which we agreed we would do with our research.

Then I started watching **Fibs, Falsehoods and Fauci**, done by Mark Levin on BlazeTV.  The main topic was discussing Trump's ad campaign and using Fauci saying in an interview ""I can’t imagine that … anybody could be doing more"" in regards to Trump. I got about 10 minutes and felt defeated. I know the situation well and knew Mark Levin was claiming verifiably false information as true. So, in our google doc, I flagged this video as verifiably false and stated that I conducted minimal research into BlazeTV's credibility. My findings were that BlazeTV has some credibility concerns.

We are currently in a back and forth on this topic, *yet again*. I'm am spending a TON of time and energy on this. Repeating to myself that I gotta put my all into this and if it doesn't work out I know I had done everything I could.

I haven't gone through the rest of his research, but I'm just feeling super down and hopeless. When do I know I need to walk away? How do I know if I should keep trying? I'm conflicted and frustrated. I always believed the truth would prevail and set me free, but it feels like the truth is being used against me.",Liberal

1541204492.0,Just a reminder that the U.S. could save over half a Trillion dollars PER YEAR by implementing 3 common sense legislation pieces the rest of the world already has," Going by the conservative estimates (from a Koch brothers funded study, that is), transferring to a single payer health care system would save on average [$200 Billion per year](https://www.mercatus.org/system/files/blahous-costs-medicare-mercatus-working-paper-v1_1.pdf). Medicare for all is something virtually every other developed nation has and has better outcomes than the U.S..

Furthermore, tax loopholes exploited by the wealthy with teams of lawyers result in the loss of around [$70 Billion per year](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/10/opinion/gabriel-zucman-paradise-papers-tax-evasion.html). Of course there will always be loopholes and even the most comprehensive legislation couldn't solve all of tax avoidance. So let's call it $50 Billion.

The final part of this trifecta is the fact the U.S. spends more on it's defense budget ($610 Billion) than the next 7 largest militaries in the world [combined](https://www.defensenews.com/industry/2018/05/02/us-remains-top-military-spender-sipri-reports/). If you were to cut our defense spending in half, that would free up over $300 Billion AND we'd still be spending $77 Billion more than the second largest military budget, that being China's. Also it's important to note that most of the worlds largest militaries are our allies so that's an even further incentive to reallocate our tax dollars to something other than the military.

Add up all those saving and you wind up with a cool $555 Billion, PER YEAR.

That amount of money is enough to fund a Trillion dollar infrastructure bill to rebuild America over 10 years, which also includes a comprehensive 5G network all over the states ($100 Billion). That's enough to create tuition free college in the U.S. ([$75 Billion](https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/07/28/487794394/hillary-s-free-tuition-promise-what-would-it-cost-how-would-it-work)), something else the rest of the developed world has. That's enough to fully restore NASA's budget to 1% of the federal budget (an additional [$30 Billion](https://www.thebalance.com/nasa-budget-current-funding-and-history-3306321)). That's enough to dive head first into complying with the Paris Climate Agreement and to combat climate change ([$150 Billion](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/06/02/fact-checking-trump-speech-paris-climate-agreement/102399674/) at the very high end even according to Trump...).

You add up all those ""pie in the sky"", ""ultra radical"" amounts and you still wind up with $200 Billion PER YEAR left over to spend. That could go very nicely into a tax cut to the middle and poor class, or fixing the Flint Michigan water crisis. Just for example.

1738621854.0,Trump’s Failed Tariff Negotiations,"So, after all that huffing and puffing, Trump caved on tariffs with both Mexico and Canada and got absolutely nothing of value in return other than straining the relationship with close allies and trading partners.

All that Mexico agreed to what they already had agreed to with Biden (without threats, by the way) and Canada just reaffirmed that they would follow throw on border measures they had passed last year anyways. Oh, and anoint a Fentanyl Czar, because that’s such a massive problem at the Canadian border.

This guy threatened a trade war with Mexico and Canada and they both just stood their ground and forced him to accept nothing in return. What a complete embarrassment. At least we avoided tariffs… for now.",Liberal

1739599356.0,Something feels different about Trump…,"Is Trump even in charge anymore? Or is he just the mascot while the real operators push their most extreme agenda?

Look at 2025—Trump barely shows up. When he does, he stumbles through speeches, loses his train of thought, and rambles incoherently. And sure, he’s always rambled, but this is different. Before, even when he was spewing nonsense, he had energy—this weird, chaotic showmanship that kept people engaged. Now, he just looks lost, like he’s struggling to keep up.

The people running the show— Elon Musk, JD Vance, Stephen Miller, the Heritage Foundation—are doing their most extreme, dystopian work because they know Trump’s base will go along with it. Trump isn’t thinking through policies or making decisions. He just signs whatever they put in front of him. The new MAGA leaders aren’t following him—they’re using him, waiting for him to fade so they can take over completely.

And something feels off about all of it. His rambling used to feel intentional, like he was riffing and playing to the crowd. Now, it just feels like he’s confused, meandering, and barely aware of what he’s saying. His movement is moving on without him, and he’s just along for the ride.

But it’s not just that he’s weaker—there’s a different vibe now. It feels more sinister. Yeah, he’s been through a lot with the courts and everything, but it also feels like he’s put people in charge who are really going to push that agenda, harder than he ever could. There’s just something missing, and I can’t quite put my finger on it. It feels almost like a weekend at Bernie’s situation — not Sanders…it’s a terrible 80s movie.",Liberal

Now, 46 percent of Americans believe Congressional Democrats are better on the economy, compared to 43 percent who believe Republicans are better, and 11 percent have no opinion.

The last time the Democrats had the upper hand in this way was under President Joe Biden in May 2021.

The fall is likely due to the implementation of tariffs which are raising the price of goods, and the Republican budget, which will increase the national deficit to $4.5 trillion by 2035 while cutting funding for Medicaid and food stamps.

I can’t think of one single thing he has done that has benefitted American citizens - not even his MAGA supporters. 

▪️60,000 federal employees have been fired. 60,000!!!! People who were providing essential services or working in science, technology, agriculture etc. Fired because Elon didn’t value their work. 
▪️Essential agencies & teams have been destroyed. Teams that monitor emerging infectious diseases, bank fraud, nuclear weapons…
▪️Price of eggs and price of gas are unchanged, if not higher. 
▪️People have lost thousands of dollars from their retirement savings and stocks because of his dumb trade war. By the way that money goes to people who are already billionaires. Others have gone to prison for the sort of stock market manipulation that he is involved in. 
▪️he is receiving secret crypto payments from anonymous entities since taking office in the White House. 
▪️Installed a whole bunch of incompetent people who are discussing war plans on a messaging app. The dignity of our federal and military entities has vanished. 
▪️Threatened war with Canada and Greenland. In case you didn’t realize, none of those countries would simply choose to become American without bloodshed. 
▪️Dismissed the President of Ukraine from the White House like a stable boy- after an embarrassing public display unlike we have ever seen in the White House. 
▪️Deportations are not as high as Biden’s or Obama’s. 
▪️Free IVF is not even being discussed ….

We’re only like 80 days in.

This birthright citizenship thing is another bright example. Most white folks don't seem to realize that when a majority of our ancestors came here there were no immigration laws.

If you came of the boat in reasonable health they let you in.
Many white folks ancestors never actually became citizens and yet their children born here became citizens. Yet these bigoted dumbfucks don't even know their own families migration story. 

The SCOTUS decision US v. Wong Kim Ark from 1898 that decided on a 6-2 vote that birthright citizenship is exactly what it says wasn't exactly a ""woke"" set of jurists.

Todays right wingers are so bigoted and xenophobic they make an all white male court from the gilded age look progressive by comparison.

1758349341.0,I Escaped Right-Wing Media. Everyone Else Should Too.,"I used to watch Fox News and was an avid listener to Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Mark Levin, and other right-wing radio personalities. I believed everything they told me, and they played a key role in establishing my worldview.

That all changed on January 6, 2021. It became clear in the aftermath of that tragedy that Trump had made up a pack of lies about the election being stolen, and had engaged in criminal conduct to hold onto power. I assumed at that point that right-wing media would stop supporting him.

Boy, was I wrong! They only doubled down in their support for him, even allowing him to use them as a bully-pulpit against his political rivals in the 2024 primary. I decided at that point I was done with right-wing media, and when the Republican party re-nominated Trump, I decided I was done with it too.

Since escaping the right-wing media bubble, I've come to realize what an alternate reality universe it is. In this fantasy land tax cuts pay for themselves, conservative judges aren't activist and rule strictly according to the Constitution, Democrats are communists who hate America, and Trump is the true American patriot come to save it.

Of course all of that is B.S., but it gets ratings, and it explains why millions of people will support Trump, no matter what he does. They need to be brought to understand that right-wing media is not news in any objective sense of the word, but rather propaganda designed to push a political agenda. Its pundits have no journalistic standards whatsoever, and they and their guests routinely omit and misrepresent facts to create their false narratives.

So cultish has their devotion to Trump become that they excuse his crimes and blatant Constitutional violations, thus making them complicit in his authoritarian takeover of the country.

Another egregious crime of right-wing media is the use of selective facts, and even outright lies, to stir up hared against migrants and trans people. As a result, their listeners are just fine with masked agents kidnapping people and sending them to concentration camps and stripping transgender people of any rights whatsoever.

Because it aids and abets criminality and fascism and spreads disinformation, right-wing media poses a clear and present danger to the Republic. I'm so glad I finally escaped from it, and everyone else should too.",Liberal

I actually forgot the interview was on yesterday. Things were just so busy for me between work and my kids, I just didn't keep up with much of anything. I read some of the articles today about how it went.

My coworker has done nothing but go from conservative buddy to conservative buddy and just rage about what was said. Everything Harris does and says is wrong. Why watch at all?! It's self-flagellation at this point. Someone finally asked her where she gets her information from. ""I mean, I keep news on my phone all day long, I just listen to it on my headphones."" Fox News.

The thing that’s funny about this is the article from Reuters is from FOUR years ago, and also Amazon never said they were going to do this, and now have debunked the claim that they will be showing tariff prices to customers.
