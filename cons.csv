1604499528.0,"Genuinely, please help me understand","I'm a democrat, and before last night I believed that with all the people coming out to vote who hadn't before, we would see Biden winning by a significant margin. To my surprise, obviously that didn't happen and a very significant portion of the country really believes in Trump apparently. I don't agree with any of his policies, and to put it lightly, I'm not a fan of his character. As a result of that, I genuinely don't understand what it is about him that compels someone to vote for him. 

But, the thing that I'm most tired of is the massive bipartisan divide in this country that has caused so much hostility from both sides, and I think the first step to improving the situation is to make a real effort to understand each other. So, if some of you would take the time to help me understand why you believe in Trump, I would appreciate it. Thanks.

EDIT: Wow, this got way more attention than I thought it would. I thought this would get two or three comments and vanish in new. Thank you all for answering, and thank you for your civility. I'm not really responding to comments because unfortunately I don't have time to have a meaningful conversation right now, but also I made this post with the intention to just listen to what you all have to say without me throwing any of my specific views into the mix. I'll try to read as many as I can, and I might respond to one or two later if I have time. 

Thanks again",Conservative

1753584104.0,If you voted for Donald Trump-- everything happening in America right now is all on you. It doesn't matter what reason you had. It's time to take accountability.,"Donald Trump has told us who he is for decades now, he's told us what he's planned to do, and so has his inner circle. If you didn't know what you were signing up for in 2016, maybe you did just get swept away in the hype and weren't fully cognizant of his entire platform. But 2024 was his third campaign. You knew. You've known for years.

You knew that Trump would give $45 billion dollars to ICE and lay the groundwork for mass deportation.

You knew that Trump would dismantle entire federal agencies and end almost all foreign aid.

You knew that Trump would end DEI initiatives.

You knew that Trump would renegotiate trade deals to prioritize Americans over our allies.

You knew that Trump would pull us out of UN organizations.

You knew that Trump would defund NPR, PBS, and left-wing universities.

You knew that Trump would prevent illegal immigrants from receiving free cosmetic surgery.

You knew that Trump would send the Marines to stop lawless protests.

You knew that Trump would pressure companies to remove artificial dyes and replace corn syrup with sugar.

You knew that Trump would bring border crossings down to their lowest number in history.

It's easy to point towards Trump and go ""it's his administration, he's the one doing it""-- but it was only possible because YOU voted for him. He didn't just win the election, he won the popular vote. Even if you lived in a ""safe blue state"", your vote has made his administration feel like they have a nationwide mandate to advance every single item on its agenda.

They then corrected it, meaning they took away 153,710 votes for biden and gave him the correct 15,371, for a net -133,889 for biden, with no change for trump.

Somebody screenshotted this and posted them in reverse order to try to make people believe fraud was happening.

Gutless, spineless, shameful bad actor. 

Did I agree with all of Charlie’s ideas? No. But I agreed with 85%+ of them, which is a lot more than I can say about basically any other public figure…

God bless his family, I hope he was at peace with God and truly saved, as much pain as his family will feel the rest of their entire lives… I at least hope they find SOME solace knowing he was saved, and that his legacy will live on for a long LONG time

I think we need to be the mature people here, which we are, and make sure we let the left know their ideas are welcome here to debate in the conservative movement. The admins here have done a fantastic job with the debate threads for example. 

We need to figure out a way how to unify again as a country...even though I disagree with the left on many things Im tired of this anger.

He wasn't a general in an army, he wasn't an ace fighter pilot that dominated the sky's, He wasn't an asset of war to be used to win battles. He was a voice... and a conduit.

The left just proved they couldnt compete with him on their own turf, with their home field advantage in simple conversation. Numerous years debating on liberal college campuses, begging for those who didnt share his values or ideas to change his mind. And now they never will be able to change his mind. They will never be able to prove or advocate their arguments anymore. In a very sad way, right as they sucker punched him, Charlie won the argument and got the last word. Because instead of changing his mind with respectable debate and fair conversation, they elected to cheat the game and resort to violence.

They thought they scratched out a MAGA champion, but I think the truth is, they silenced their own voice. Who now among their opposition will respect them and be willing to hear their words? Who now among their opposition will grant them goodwill and a shared platform. Are any conservatives going to parlay with cheaters who were enraged with hatred over a voice?

You couldnt change his mind, and now... you will never change ours.

He was the president.  He still had all the powers of the president.  The 25th amendment provides a mechanism for removing those powers should he become incapable of executing his duties.  If he was senile, it was up to Harris and the cabinet to act.  Or for Congress to impeach him.",Conservative

1740146333.0,This sub has been infiltrated by fake conservatives,"I've noticed an increase in ""fellow conservatives"" posting here since the election. They have flair, so they are allowed to comment and even create posts.

A quick browse through recent comments and posts by these accounts make it clear that these are NOT in any way conservatives.  These are NOT people with conservative values who simply do not like Trump. They are frauds who found a way to get flair so the far left can post with the goal of undermining the purpose of this sub,

I called out one of these accounts in one of the hockey threads. Within an hour it is at -4. I also noticed that all of other comments, even those made in non-political subs, have all been downvoted within the past hour.

Mods, please do something about these fake accounts, and if you can, do something about those of us being stalked by these lunatics that get off on going through people's post history and downvoting every comment they have ever made.

Edit: Thanks for the RedditCares report. Thanks, but I'm doing fine. Also received a lovely obscene DM calling all conservatives traitors.

Edit #2: Obscene and personal attack MDs up over a dozen now. Seems I touched a nerve.

Wanted to clarify that I think the mods do a good job here. They do welcome discussion and not a single-minded purity test, which some will take advantage of in order to gain access so they can try and disrupt things.

I welcome honest discussion and differing points of view. What I'm calling out are those who openly show their hatred for all things conservative in other subs, then come here are act like they are one themselves.

Edit #3: It's a close race between Not-Z or snowflake for the most used word in DMs. Which will win? It's like a game now :)

Edit #4: Had to block all DMs. The crazies couldn't handle that so they started posting in my old non-conservative sub posts. Same race to the finish with the name calling. ",Conservative

Specifically, things like #democrats or #bluewave are retrieving a ""We've hidden these results"" screen or ""results for the term you searched for may contain sensitive content.""  Can anyone confirm?

I know myself and many of you have long advocated for free and fair expression for *all* on social media platforms as long as said expression does not violate the law or specifically go against the platform TOS (which they are within their rights to set as private companies).

If this is indeed happening, how should we as supporters of free speech go about making sure that no one is silenced or de-platformed without just cause the way so many of us were?

**EDIT** It makes me very happy to see the responses agreeing that censorship of dissenting voices is wrong and should not be tolerated.  It makes this old veteran proud to see.

**EDIT 2** To all of the non-conservatives that are sending me chat requests and having rational, good faith discussions with me, thank you so very much.

1741387037.0,Anyone else feel as if most of Reddit has gone completely insane?,"I read the posts on various Reddit subs, and it seems to me that much/most of Reddit has gone batshit crazy.  Every little thing Trump says or doesn't say will somehow lead to World War 3, the collapse of the dollar and the collapse of America and only democrats, yes those same dems that just got their asses handed to them, can save us!

Someone posted a blue ""Is he dead yet"" hat on some sub, and countless weirdos were quite excited about it, and we all know what they were talking about.  Most of us were not fans of Biden/Harris or the dems, but we don't want anyone to die.  We just wanted to beat them at the polls.  Apparently, that's not how many democrats feel about our side.

It seems that the left have lost their collective minds, particularly so here on Reddit.

P.S. Today is the day that butthurt leftists are boycotting Amazon, so if you need anything from AMZN, it's a good day to shop there, imo.

Last election I felt so unrepresented in the Democratic Party I voted for Trump, however I didn’t think of myself as a Republican, just an American that wanted a better direction for the country. 

After today I don’t think I could ever vote for a democratic candidate at any level. I liked Charlie a lot. I didn’t agree with everything he said, and to be honest I’m not even confident if he was a good person or not. But I knew he cared deeply about what he thought was best for our nation. How horrible this assassination was for our nation aside, the response online from liberals and democrats has been astoundingly hateful to the degree it surprised me. I knew about how deeply ingrained party politics could divide us, but I didn’t expect anything I’ve seen so far. Perhaps Charlie saw this long before I did. In some ways I feel responsible for not opening my eyes sooner, if many of us did perhaps he’d still be alive. I’m not sure if our nation can recover at this point, but i think that makes peace, unity, and perhaps most importantly free speech all the more worth fighting for. ",Conservative

I think this is a pretty clear cut case of self defense on Kyle's part, and I shouldn't have made a judgement before having all the facts. Kyle had a gun pointed at him by a man who had previously threatened him- I can't say I'd have done much different.

So here's me eating crow!

-your friendly 2A liberal

Edit: this is really blowing up, and I can't respond to everyone- I'm sorry!
I wrote this post to admit that I made a mistake; I appreciate the commenters who have been respectful and helpful in their responses.

To the people making fun of me,  calling me a communist, blaming me for the woes of this country: that's not going to win anyone to your side.   I'm not here to argue or debate, just admit that I was wrong on this issue. I wish you and your families the very best!

Edit 2: I'm so overwhelmed with the response to this. I had written a rather angry diatribe here, but decided to delete it.  Some redditors said some pretty nasty things to me, both conservatives, and liberals. It got under my skin, but I'd rather focus on the **many** awesome conservatives who have engaged in civil discourse with me. I've learned much from listening to you all. 

Edit 3: Yes, I saw the videos- I felt they were missing context. That context was explained in court, and I see where I was wrong.  
Everyone is asking why I believed Kyle was in the wrong here:
I felt that he put himself in a situation that he wasn't prepared for,  with a rifle he didn't legally aquire. From my perspective, that looked an awful lot like someone who went to a riot *looking* for an opportunity to use the gun.  The reality is that,  while I think he shouldn't have been there,  the asshole he killed was following him around harassing and threatening him.  I can't fault Kyle for defending himself, and its not my place to determine his motives. Hope that makes sense. I understand from talking with some of you here that Kyle was there to protect his community, and I can accept that his motives were good, though ill advised IMO.

1757871481.0,What Charlie actually said about gun deaths,"CHARLIE KIRK: “Yeah, it's a great question. Thank you. So, I'm a big Second Amendment fan but I think most politicians are cowards when it comes to defending why we have a Second Amendment. This is why I would not be a good politician, or maybe I would, I don't know, because I actually speak my mind.

The Second Amendment is not about hunting. I love hunting. The Second Amendment is not even about personal defense. That is important. The Second Amendment is there, God forbid, so that you can defend yourself against a tyrannical government. And if that talk scares you ""wow, that's radical, Charlie, I don't know about that well then, you have not really read any of the literature of our Founding Fathers. Number two, you've not read any 20th-century history. You're just living in Narnia. By the way, if you're actually living in Namia, you would be wiser than wherever you're living, because C.S. Lewis was really smart. So I don't know what alternative universe you're living in. You just don't want to face reality that governments tend to get tyrannical and that if people need an ability to protect themselves and their communities and their families.

Now, we must also be real. We must be honest with the population. Having an armed citizenry comes with a price, and that is part of liberty. Driving comes with a price. 50,000, 50,000, 50,000 people die on the road every year. That's a price. You get rid of driving, you'd have 50,000 less auto fatalities. But we have decided that the benefit of driving speed, accessibility, mobility, having products, services - is worth the cost of 50,000 people dying on the road. So we need to be very clear that you're not going to get gun deaths to zero. It will not happen. You could significantly reduce them through having more fathers in the home, by having more armed guards in front of schools. We should have a honest and clear reductionist view of gun violence, but we should not have a utopian one.

You will never live in a society when you have an armed citizenry and you won't have a single gun death. That is nonsense. It's drivel. But I am, I, I-I think it's worth it. I think it's worth to have a cost of, unfortunately, some gun deaths every single year so that we can have the Second Amendment to protect our other God-given rights. That is a prudent deal. It is rational. Nobody talks like this. They live in a complete alternate universe.

So then, how do you reduce? Very simple. People say, oh, Charlie, how do you stop school shootings? I don't know. How did we stop shootings at baseball games? Because we have armed guards outside of baseball games. That's why. How did we stop all the shootings at airports? We have armed guards outside of airports. How do we stop all the shootings at banks? We have armed guards outside of banks. How did we stop all the shootings at gun shows? Notice there's not a lot of mass shootings at gun shows, there's all these guns. Because everyone's armed. If our money and our sporting events and our airplanes have armed guards, why don't our children?”",Conservative

1750222642.0,"As an American living in Japan, here’s what real immigration enforcement looks like and why I get frustrated when I see foreign flags flown in the U.S.","I’m a US citizen living and working in Japan. I’ve been stopped by Japanese police *three times* and asked to show my ID. Two of those times, I was in a full suit near the US Embassy, clearly not looking for trouble. The third time, I was just walking with my (Japanese) ex.

Each time, I had to hand over my residence card on the spot. Why? Because **Japanese law requires all foreigners to carry their ID at all times** (Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition Act, Article 23). If I didn’t have it, I could be detained, fined, or worse. There’s no debate. No protest. No “that’s discrimination.” It’s the law, and you *respect it* if you want to stay.

What’s more, Japan doesn’t mess around when it comes to protest. As a noncitizen, if I were to join a public demonstration or speak out against the government too loudly, my **visa or permanent residency could be revoked**. You’re here by permission, not entitlement. That’s how it works.

So when I see people in American cities like LA waving massive Mexican flags during protests, often while demanding changes to US immigration policy, I get pissed off. Not because they’re proud of their heritage. But because I know that *in most of the world,* especially places like Japan, foreigners don’t get to do that. Not without serious consequences.

America is the only country I’ve lived in where people show up illegally, then demand rights and wave the flag of the country they supposedly left behind. Try that in Japan, China, South Korea, or even most of Europe and see how long you last.

It’s not racist to enforce your border or expect assimilation. It’s *normal.* And if more Americans saw how other countries handle immigration, they’d stop apologizing for having basic standards.",Conservative
